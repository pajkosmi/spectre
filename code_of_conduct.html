<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p ><a class="anchor" id="md_docs_CODE_OF_CONDUCT"></a> With the goal of supporting our community in doing the best science we can, we expect that all contributors and maintainers of SpECTRE:</p>
<ul>
<li>Behave professionally in a way that is welcoming and respectful to all participants.</li>
<li>Behave in a way that is free from any form of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation.</li>
<li>Treat each other with collegiality and respect and help to create a supportive working environment.</li>
</ul>
<p >This code of conduct is not an exhaustive list of things that you should or should not do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended — a guide to make it easier to communicate and participate in the community.</p>
<p >This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the SpECTRE project. This includes Slack channels, wikis, mailing lists, issue trackers, pull request comments, SpECTRE project events, and any other forums created by the project for communication. It applies to all of your communication and conduct in these spaces, including emails, chats, things you say, slides, videos, posters, signs, or even t-shirts you display in these spaces. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may, in rare cases, affect a person’s ability to participate within them, when the conduct amounts to an egregious violation of this code.</p>
<p >If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing <a href="#" onclick="location.href='mai'+'lto:'+'con'+'du'+'ct@'+'sp'+'ect'+'re'+'-co'+'de'+'.or'+'g'; return false;">condu<span class="obfuscator">.nosp@m.</span>ct@s<span class="obfuscator">.nosp@m.</span>pectr<span class="obfuscator">.nosp@m.</span>e-co<span class="obfuscator">.nosp@m.</span>de.or<span class="obfuscator">.nosp@m.</span>g</a>. For more details please see our <a class="el" href="reporting_guide.html">Reporting Guide</a>. If you would rather not formally report your concern, you should feel free to discuss it informally and confidentially with one of the project leaders.</p>
<p >More specifically, we expect members of the SpECTRE community to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be friendly and patient. During teleconferences and meetings, participants who wish to speak should feel free to type “hand up” or similar in the comment box, as needed, to get the chairs’ attention. Meeting/teleconference chairs are encouraged to make space for those unfamiliar with the topic of discussion to ask questions and engage.</li>
<li>Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion or lack thereof, and mental and physical ability.</li>
<li>Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account. Remember that we are a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.</li>
<li>Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It is important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the SpECTRE community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the community.</li>
<li>Be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:<ul>
<li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
<li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Persisting in such behavior after being asked to stop is considered harassment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time, and SpECTRE is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we are different. The strength of communities comes from having a varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint does not mean that they are wrong. Do not forget that it is human to err and blaming each other does not get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</li>
</ul>
